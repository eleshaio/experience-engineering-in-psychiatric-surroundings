"Suicide Within Therapy" – In Psychotherapy with a Hospitalized Adolescent

Yoram Hazan

Adolescent Department, Itanim Hospital

During a treatment process with a psychoanalytical orientation in the adolescent department, a unique encounter took place between a patient who, in order to live, had to feel death within his schizophrenic experience, and a therapist who, in order to understand, had to experience the patient’s death – within the therapy.

Reviving the patient’s inner world and understanding the forces operating within it through psychotherapy, within the “therapeutic reality” of the department, is the foundation of treatment in a psychoanalytical orientation in cases of deep-seated disorders. This concerns a 17-year-old adolescent who arrived at the department following a self-harm attempt. The young son among nine children, from a large family in southern Israel. His older sister committed suicide at the age of 18 when he was four. His paternal aunt also died of a chronic illness at the age of 18 in the father’s country of origin. In his wallet, his father carries photos of both, and his daughter is named after his sister.

During the therapy, the crisis was reactivated — this time in response to the departure of the therapist. We will outline the main stages of the treatment, with a detailed focus on the turning point surrounding the suicide attempt that occurred within therapy. The possibility of transferring the process emerged from the parallel event within the department’s team — the therapist was “accused” by the team, as opposed to what “did not” occur in the original event.

At the level of elucidation, we learned from the therapy: A. Regarding the similarities and differences between the case described by Freud (Schreiber) and the adolescent we treated. The basis for comparison is the perspective of Berger, who saw in Schreiber’s psychotic crisis a necessary reconstruction of a traumatic past. B. From “suicide within therapy” it was possible to define the state of a therapist whose patient commits suicide during therapy. Here we referred to two rare articles that discuss a therapist’s reactions in such cases (by Byon, Gorkin).

It summarizes the case through the question of the place of psychotherapy in similar cases of adolescents in crisis, against the backdrop of a deep-seated disorder.
