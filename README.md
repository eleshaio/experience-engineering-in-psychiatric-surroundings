# Experience Engineering in Psychiatric Surroundings

## Example Case

From ["Suicide Within Therapy" – In Psychotherapy with a Hospitalized Adolescent](https://github.com/eleshaio/experience-engineering-in-psychiatric-surroundings/tree/main/cases/suicide-within-treatment-eithanim)



- **During the therapy, the crisis was reactivated** —
-  **in response to the departure of the therapist**. 
- **the suicide attempt that occurred within therapy**.
- The possibility of transferring the process emerged from the parallel event within the department’s team — **the therapist was “accused” by the team, as opposed to what “did not” occur in the original event**.
