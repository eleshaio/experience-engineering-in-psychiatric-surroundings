## Example Case

Reviving the patient’s inner world and understanding the forces operating within it through psychotherapy, within the “therapeutic reality” of the department, is the foundation of treatment in a psychoanalytical orientation in cases of deep-seated disorders. This concerns a 17-year-old adolescent who arrived at the department following a self-harm attempt. The young son among nine children, from a large family in southern Israel. His older sister committed suicide at the age of 18 when he was four. His paternal aunt also died of a chronic illness at the age of 18 in the father’s country of origin. In his wallet, his father carries photos of both, and his daughter is named after his sister.


**During the therapy, the crisis was reactivated** — this time **in response to the departure of the therapist**. We will outline the main stages of the treatment, with a detailed focus on the turning point surrounding **the suicide attempt that occurred within therapy**. The possibility of transferring the process emerged from the parallel event within the department’s team — **the therapist was “accused” by the team, as opposed to what “did not” occur in the original event**.
