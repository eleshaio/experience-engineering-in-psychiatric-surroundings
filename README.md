## Example Case

From ["Suicide Within Therapy" – In Psychotherapy with a Hospitalized Adolescent](https://github.com/eleshaio/experience-engineering-in-psychiatric-surroundings/tree/main/cases/suicide-within-treatment-eithanim)

> **The crisis was reactivated during therapy** .. **triggered by the therapist's departure**.

> **A suicide attempt occurred during the therapy session**.

> The potential for transferring the process arose from a parallel event within the department’s team — **the therapist was “accused” by the team, contrasting with what “did not” happen in the original event**.
